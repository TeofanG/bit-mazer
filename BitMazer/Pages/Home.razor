            <div class="mb-4">
                <h5 class="fs-5">🔐 What encryption method is used?</h5>
                <p class="fs-6 text-muted">
                    You can choose from several authenticated encryption algorithms to secure your data, 
                    including AES-GCM, XChaCha20-Poly1305, Rabbit, and Twofish.
                    These algorithms ensure both confidentiality and integrity, 
                    protecting your data from unauthorized access and tampering.

            <div class="mb-4">
                <h5 class="fs-5">📁 Is my file uploaded anywhere?</h5>
                <p class="fs-6 text-muted">No. All encryption and decryption is done locally in your browser. Your files never leave your device.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="mb-4">
                <h5 class="fs-5">🗝️ What is the key and how should I use it?</h5>
                <p class="fs-6 text-muted">You will be asked to enter or generate a secret key. Keep this safe, as it's required to decrypt your files later.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="mb-4">
                <h5 class="fs-5">📥 Can I decrypt a file on a different device?</h5>
                <p class="fs-6 text-muted">Yes, as long as you use the same secret key used during encryption.</p>
            </div>

            <div>
                <h5 class="fs-5">⚠️ What file types are supported?</h5>
